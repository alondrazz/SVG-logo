# SVG-logo

## I had to make a SVG logo and I did that by using the Node.js command-line. I also had to use Jest and Inquirer.

## You can copy the link below and you can watch how I opened my applicaton, and how I got the logo to be made. You are also going to need to copy my repo to your terminal.
"C:\Users\alond\Downloads\SVG logo.mp4"

## You can use this for whenever you need help making a logo and getting started using the Node.js command-line.

## I had a lot of help from my tutor, he helped me get started and I also looked at my past activities from last classes, and also w3schools.
